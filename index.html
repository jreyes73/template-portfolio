        <p>This Portfolio Website is my first major project. This site contains the work that displays my abilities in web developement and front-end development. You can find a brieft self-introduction, projects, my skills, and my contact information on this site. Feel free to explore and click on the various interactive links and buttons. Additionally, you can resize the broswer's window to scrutinize the responsiveness of the site.</p>
        <p>As for the design of this site, I decided to try something a bit different from what I am used to. Normally, when styling boxes, I like to have rounded edges and blurry shadow effects. Here, you can see I went with sharp corners and more defined shadows. I have seen this done on Codecademy's website and it has really grown on me. Lastly, I think the simple color scheme that I went with makes for a more modern look.</p>
        <p>Oh, one more thing... I expect I can keep this updated sort of like a living document. I want update my profile to include new projects.</p>
